## ACM ICN 2023 Visa Information

Because the Iceland is part of the Schengen Area, citizens of the EU member states, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Japan, Switzerland, USA, and many other countries may travel to Reykjavik without a visa. Please check whether you need a Schengen visa to enter the Iceland, e.g., by looking up the visa requirements for citizens of your nationality on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Visa_requirements_by_nationality) or by directly contacting the [Embassy of the Iceland](https://www.government.is/topics/foreign-affairs/visa-to-iceland/) (or any other Schengen country) accredited to the country of your current residence. If you do need the Schengen visa, please proceed promptly with applying for the visa, because visa processing is unpredictable and might take a significant amount of time.

### Visa support letter

As part of the visa application process, you may be required to include a visa support letter. To request a visa support letter, register for the conference and then email your request to the [Conference General Chairs](mailto:icn23-chairs@sigcomm.org) with the following information included:

- Your name as it appears in your passport;
- Your current postal mailing address;
- ACM ICN 2023 as the name of the conference you wish to attend;
- If you have any papers accepted for the conference, please provide the title and indicate whether you are the "sole author" or a "co-author";
- Your email address.

Visa support letters are answered in the order they are received. You will receive a PDF letter by email in 7-10 business days. The PDF serves as a signed electronic version of the original letter. Please print out your PDF visa support letter and take it with you to your visa appointment. The original letter is mailed only upon an explicit request. Note that visa support letters will be provided to only those participants who have registered and paid for the conference. Should a participant withdraw from the conference after the issue of the visa support letter, the consulate will be notified of the withdrawal accordingly.

Please note that the conference does not issue formal letters of invitation to any ACM-sponsored conferences.

If you face any problems with the above process or have other concerns, please contact [conference general chairs](mailto:icn23-chairs@sigcomm.org).

Thank you and best of luck with your travels!
