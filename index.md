## Welcome to NDN Community Meeting 2025!

The 2025 Named Data Networking Community Meeting (NDNComm’25) will be hosted by UCLA as a hybrid meeting during April 17-18, 2025.

NDNComm is an annual event that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, government, as well as individuals interested in the development of the Named Data Networking (NDN) technology, providing the community a forum to exchange the latest results on the development of NDN protocols, software, testbed, and applications, and to discuss/debate on future directions.

The organizing committee of NDNComm’25 cordially invites you to participate in this event and calls for your contributions.
