The Conference Organizing Committee aims to provide as much travel support to as many student conference attendees as possible.

### Who Should Apply?

The committee strongly prefers applicants who are not the paper's first author (the committee believes that authors' home organizations should cover costs for the first author). Poster authors, however, are encouraged to apply. Other evaluation criteria will include evidence of a serious interest in networking, as demonstrated by project experience. ACM-ICN especially encourages the participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and people with disabilities.

### What is Covered?

The level of support provided will depend on the finances of the conference and the needs of each award recipient. The grant will partially cover travel expenses (transportation, hotel, and meals not included in the conference registration) but not the conference registration fee. The applicant is expected to cover the remaining expenses through other means. The level of support and the reimbursement details will be announced to award recipients (Note that travel reimbursement will only be after the conference, on submission of receipts).

### Who Decides?

Applicants will be selected by the ACM ICN travel grant committee.

### How to Apply

To apply, each application for a travel award should be submitted through the [Google form](https://forms.gle/rKgUycUWKxqv4oqMA). **The application should be submitted in a single PDF** file and include the following: 

1. A letter of application, including:

- A CV with complete contact information and email address,
- A personal statement (no more than 1 page) indicates the applicant will attend ACM ICN 2023 in person. It includes information that the applicant feels is relevant to support her/his case on how the student would benefit from attending ACM ICN 2023. This includes why conference attendance is important to the applicant's research and career development and information about ways that the student will improve the diversity and inclusiveness of the conference,  The applicant should mention any papers or posters they submitted or have accepted and whether they are presenting any work, and whether she/he has applied for any other funding support,
- On a second page, include estimated expenses for attending the conference (total and breakdown by conference registration, travel, lodging, and meals),

2. A letter of support from the applicant's advisor. The letter should: 
- confirm the applicant's standing at their institution (date started, the program of study), 
- indicate current funding status, or explain why the applicant is in need of a travel grant,
- confirm that the balance of the applicantâ€™s expenses will be covered through other sources.

Applications that do not include the above items will not be considered. The expectation is that a student travel grant will significantly offset the expenses though it may not fully cover these expenses. Before awarding a travel grant, the organizing committee may request further clarifications from the student advisor.
