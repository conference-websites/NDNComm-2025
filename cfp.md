### Towards a Secure, Resilient, and Decentralized Future Internet via Named Data Networking

The 2025 Named Data Networking Community Meeting (NDNComm’25) will be hosted by UCLA as a hybrid meeting during April 17-18, 2025\. NDNComm is an annual event that brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, government, as well as individuals interested in the development of the Named Data Networking (NDN) technology, providing the community a forum to exchange the latest results on the development of NDN protocols, software, testbed, and applications, and to discuss/debate on future directions.  The organizing committee of NDNComm’25 cordially invites you to participate in this event and calls for your contributions. 

We invite submissions from the broader NDN community for presentations (short or long), posters/demos, and panels on topics that cover all aspects of NDN. Interesting topics include but not limited to the following:

* Identifying security challenges facing the Internet today, how NDN-based solutions may help address those challenges.  
* New applications that can benefit from NDN, such as those serving tactical edge, autonomous driving, industrial IoT, drones coordination, satellite communications, and high-volume data processing (for scientific computing or AI/ML).  
* Edge computing that utilizes in-network storage and computing resources without dependency on the cloud; support for new applications.  
* Usability of NDN technologies in terms of tools/libraries/testbeds/etc.  
* Novel APIs targeting a user-friendly experience for NDN application developers.

With regard to the security and consolidation focus, we are particularly interested in:

* Sharing identified security problems in networked systems and comprehensive analyses of the security solutions currently deployed, such as firewalls, VPNs, TLS, and MaaS (mitigation as a service), for an in-depth understanding of how these deployed solutions may or may not work together harmoniously, what are remaining gaps among them to form an effective defense for the global Internet. Also sharing identified security challenges in new applications, such as large language models.  
* Sharing insights on the root cause factors for today’s consolidated network resources and applications, as well as on effective countermeasures to steer the Internet away from further consolidation. As an example of the latter, we plan to engage all participants of NDNComm’25 in a hands-on trial with *NDN Workspace (NWS)*, a newly developed decentralized app over NDN.  We plan to use NWS for meeting material sharing and chatroom communication, to demonstrate NDN’s power to enable secure, decentralized apps, and to gather the community’s inputs on its further improvement.
